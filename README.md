This is a personal project I built to help me search memes I have saved from the Internet.

I also built this project to gain a deeper understanding on how [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot),
[Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security), [Spring Session](https://spring.io/projects/spring-session),
[Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa), [Spring AI](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai),
[AWS SDK for Java](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/), [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/),
[Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/) and a bunch of other Java libraries work together to build a
scalable, production-grade Java web application.

If this application is useful or interesting to you, consider giving it a star on
[GitHub](https://github.com/arvl130/mmm-ui).

This application also comes with a backend REST API available [here](https://github.com/arvl130/mmm).
